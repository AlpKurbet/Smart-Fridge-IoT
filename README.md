# Smart-Fridge-IoT


A small section of a smart fridge project that would detect the transactions of the customer via sensors and image proocessing.

This proect is designed to work on an ESP 8266 first and then on a Nvidia Jetson to support the Image Processing actions.

This is merely a demonstration of a smal section of the project.

I can only share "hardwarehandlers" , "scalehandlers" and the "frid" files due to privacy issues.
